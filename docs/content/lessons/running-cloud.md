### Running in Oracle Cloud 

As a stop-gap for this section let me point you to a workshop my friend wrote for Oracle Cloud. 
It's a great resource for learning in it's own right but should give you the necessary information you 
need to run everything in Oracle Cloud.

You can get $300 to spend in our cloud here   
https://cloud.oracle.com/tryit

And follow along with "Container Native Development" (you can also run this locally)  
https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/workshops/container-native-development/
